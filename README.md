## How to use?
1. Connect your numworks calculator, make sure your calculator is regonised by your computer.
2. Run the script and let it do its thing.
3. Unplug and replug the calculator when the script asks you to. Make sure to press "ok" on the calculator when it tells you that you're running unofficial software.
4. Tada! You're done.
